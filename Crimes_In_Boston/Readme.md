# ðŸ“Š Crime Patterns in Boston
### Project Overview
This project analyzes open crime data from the City of Boston to uncover patterns related to time, location, and crime type.
The analysis explores how crime trends evolved before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and identifies areas with the highest crime density.

## Dataset
* Source: City of Boston Open Data Portal

* Features: Incident type, date and time, location (latitude/longitude), and other attributes.

### Key Questions
* How does crime vary by day of the week and time of day?

* How did the pandemic impact crime rates and types?

* Which neighborhoods have the highest total crime, and which have the highest crime density?

### Tools and Libraries
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy

* **PDF reader:** PyMuPdf

* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

* **Geospatial analysis:** Geopy, Geopandas

* **Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis**

### Main Findings
* General crime declined during the pandemic, but homicides increased.

* Dorchester, Roxbury, and Jamaica Plain have the highest number of incidents overall.

* When adjusting for area, the Leather District has the highest crime density.

* Downtown neighborhoods (Leather District, South End, Back Bay, Downtown, Chinatown) account for over 46% of total crime density.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.

2. Install required libraries:

~~~bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopy geopandas 
~~~
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
